## On [Dralun](https://dralun.com), the Land of Deed to Domain

Use the [UR.Land](https://ur.land) map to visit a continent filled with amazing peoples and lands. 

The concept of *domain deed* can mean one of the following:

- a 3rd party provider of domain names, subject to a formal registrar of ICAHNN
- a licensed domain when sold withen a controlled group, offers more value than sold individually (similar to the .com)
- an easy way to build sites on a project to project basis

Domains can be permenently transferred, or temporarily licensed, depending on the need.

All domain rights are dependent on the deed, see the following table of deed types:

|**Deed**|**Domain Rights**|Cost|
|-|-|-|
|nomad|*basic* editor<br/>*basic* user|Free|
|civilian|tenent|$7.99|
|tenent|licensed||
|owner|transfer||

Nomad and Civilian deeds are domain non-specific and are used to extend UR.Land functionality,

- Create and post artifiacts
- Run scenarios
- "Live" (and vote) withen any domain (Civilian only)

Tenent deeds (Domain licenses) must be renewed same as with domain registrations. 

Owner deeds (Domain transfers) are permanent and require only the one-time fee.
