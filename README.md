## [Dralun](https://dralun.com), the Land of Deed to Domain

Open the [UR.Land](https://ur.land) map and visit a continent filled with amazing peoples and lands. 

Some of **Dralun**'s features, include,

- View the entire set of [deed listings](https://github.com/nfnth/nfnth/blob/master/doc/DEED.md), with option to:
  - [purchase]() as **Owner**
  - [claim]() as **Tenant**
  - [proceed]() as **Civilian**
- Use the **Markre** editor at [nfnth.com](https://nfnth.com), with tools to: 
  - Post artifacts
  - Create a profile (in MarkDown 2.0)
- Setup your own domain using the **Jaspre** engine:
  - Run the **brOS** build script, see [**On Development**](#on-development)

All domain rights are dependent on the deed, see the following list of deed types:

|**Deed**|**Domain Rights**|

Deeds may be transferred at any time, see [deed transfers]().
