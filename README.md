## On [Dralun](https://dralun.com), the Land of Deed to Domain

Nomad and Civilian deeds are domain non-specific and are used to extend UR.Land functionality,

- Create and post artifiacts
- Run scenarios
- "Live" (and vote) withen any domain (Civilian only)

Owner deeds (transferred) 

Use the [UR.Land](https://ur.land) map to visit a continent filled with amazing peoples and lands. 

#### Domain Deeds

**Dralun** is the concept of the *domain deed*, a differentiaion between control and content.

For most cases this is a non-issue, take the example of domain https://twitter.com/nfnth. Upon transfer (of password), both control and content are transferred.

Unfortunately with base domains, ie. https://tactician.us, it's not as simple. Upon transfer (of registrar password), only control is transferred. All content is subject to variation based on time and/or intent of either party involved...

Thus, by definition then, *domain deed* becomes the representation of both the control and content, the said **source** of a digital property.

This can be used to mean one of the following:

- access to name records, subject to a formal registrar of ICAHNN (as typically used) (requires permanent transfer)
- access to digital property associated to domain (similar to copyright license)
- (both) access to control and access to source

Domain rights can vary, see the following table of deed types:

|**Deed**|**Domain Rights**|Cost|
|-|-|-|
|nomad|*basic* editor<br/>*basic* user|Free|
|civilian|tenent|$7.99|
|tenent|licensed|Tenent deeds (Domain licenses) must be renewed same as with domain registrations. |
|controller|transfer|Controller has control access, source content is not guaranteed.|
|owner|transfer|Owner has control access and rights to source content. Owner deeds (Domain transfers) are permanent and require only the one-time fee.|

Domains can be permenently transferred, or temporarily licensed, depending on the need.
