## On [Dralun](https://dralun.com), Land of Deed to Domain

Dralun is a land build upon the people and the deeds etched in code.

Key **Dralun** features, include:

- access to the [deed regisrty](https://github.com/nfnth/nfnth/blob/master/doc/DEED.md), with options to,
  - [purchase]() as **Owner**, [claim]() as **Tenant**, or [proceed]() as **Civilian**
  - view public records of all purchase, forfeiture, and transfer
  - review historical context
- use of the **Markre** editor, see [nfnth.com](https://nfnth.com), with tools to,
  - Create *artifacts* (includes text, image, location)
  - Create profile (in MarkDown 2.0) for user and domains
  - Use MarkDown 2.0 constructs, such as treaty and strategy
- instruction for the **Jaspre** engine, to setup a custom domain,
  - Run the **brOS** build script, see [gist]()

For upcoming feaures, go to the [PLANME.md](https://github.com/users/nfnth/projects/3) project page

#### Civilian Class

Nomad and Civilian deeds are domain non-specific and are used to extend UR.Land functionality,

Nomads, Create and post artifiacts

- Civilians, Run scenarios "Live" (and vote) withen any domain (Civilian only)
- Tenants, control over content only
- Owner, control over access and content

To begin, [sign in]() (or [create an account]()), to recieve a user badge with **Nomad** status.

### On Deed

**Dralun** is the concept of the *domain deed*, a differentiaion between control and content.

This can be used to mean one of the following:

- access to name records, subject to a formal registrar of ICAHNN (as typically used) (requires permanent transfer)
- access to digital property associated to domain (similar to copyright license)
- (both) access to control and access to source

For example, use domain https://twitter.com/nfnth, upon transfer (of password), both control and content are transferred.

On the other hand, with base domains, ie. https://twitter.com, it's not as simple. Upon transfer (of registrar password), only control is transferred. 

The difference with base domains is that all content is subject to the intent of both parties involved...

Thus a need for *domain deed* to become the representation of both control and content, the said **source** of a digital property.

Dralun uses user groupings to differentiate, see the following table of deed types:

|**Dralun Deed**|Control?|Content?|Description|
|-|-|-|-|
|nomad|NA|NA|Free|
|civilian|NA|NA|Vote|
|tenent|No|Yes|Tenent deeds (Domain licenses) must be renewed same as with domain registrations. |
|controller|Yes|No|Controller has control access, source content is not guaranteed.|
|owner|Yes|Yes|Owner has control access and rights to source content. Owner deeds (Domain transfers) are permanent and require only the one-time fee.|

Domains can be permenently transferred, or temporarily licensed, depending on the need.

### On Development

Dralun is built on brOS, a light-weight, open-source stack, to host our platforms using [Linode]() and [GitHub]().
