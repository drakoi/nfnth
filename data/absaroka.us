The Absaroka Range (/əbˈsɔːrkə/ or locally /əbˈsɔːrki/) is a sub-range of the Rocky Mountains in the United States. The range stretches about 150 mi (240 km) across the Montana–Wyoming border, and 75 miles at its widest, forming the eastern boundary of Yellowstone National Park along Paradise Valley, and the western side of the Bighorn Basin. The range borders the Beartooth Mountains to the north and the Wind River Range to the south. The northern edge of the range rests along I-90 and Livingston, Montana. The highest peak in the range is Francs Peak, located in Wyoming at 13,153 ft (4,009 m). There are 46 other peaks over 12,000 ft (3,700 m).
Absaroka was an area in the United States, comprising parts of the states of Montana, South Dakota, and Wyoming, that contemplated secession and statehood in 1939. Absaroka is from the Crow word meaning "children of the large-beaked bird", also the namesake of the Absaroka mountain range. This region largely belongs to the Crow people and the Sioux, according to the Treaty of Fort Laramie (1851).
