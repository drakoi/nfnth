Mount Agamenticus is a 692 ft (211 m) high monadanock in the town of York, Maine.[1] The greater Agamenticus region covers nearly 30,000 acres (12,000 ha) in the southern Maine towns of Eliot, Ogunquit, South Berwick, Wells and York.[citation needed] The area surrounding the summit is a park reservation which provides habitat for wildlife and a venue for recreation. At the mountain peak is the burial place of Mi'kmaq Chief St. Aspinquid.
