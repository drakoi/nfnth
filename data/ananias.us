Ananias (/ænəˈnaɪəs/ AN-ə-NY-əs; Ancient Greek: Ἀνανίας from Hebrew חנניה, Hananiah, "favoured of the LORD")[1] was a disciple of Jesus at Damascus mentioned in the Acts of the Apostles in the Bible, which describes how he was sent by Jesus to restore the sight of Saul of Tarsus (who later was called Paul the Apostle) and provide him with additional instruction in the way of the Lord.[2]
