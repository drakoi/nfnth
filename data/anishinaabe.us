The Anishinaabe are a group of culturally related indigenous peoples present in what is now Canada and the United States. They include the Ojibwe (including Mississaugas), Odawa, Potawatomi, Saulteaux, Oji-Cree, and Algonquin peoples. The Anishinaabe speak Anishinaabemowin, or Anishinaabe languages that belong to the Algonquian language family. At first contact with Europeans they lived in the Northeast Woodlands and Subarctic, and some have since spread to the Great Plains.
