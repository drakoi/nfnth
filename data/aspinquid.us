Tradition indicates Thury named the chapel after a Miâ€™kmaq Chief Aspinquid (Aspenquid), who converted to Catholicism and drew many others into the faith. Thury arrived at Acadia in 1684 and travelled with St. Aspinquid throughout the region, including present-day Nova Scotia.[1][2][3] (During much of the 17th and early 18th centuries, Norridgewock on the Kennebec River and Castine at the end of the Penobscot River were the southernmost settlements of Acadia.)[4]

Chief Aspinquid was the "Chief Sacham of all the Tribes of Indians in the Northern District of North America."[5] During King William's War he was also a political figure who signed a treaty with Massachusetts Governor William Phips on August 11, 1693.[6] Captain Pasco Chubb murdered Chief Aspinquid at Pemaquid in February 1696.[7] Thury, a Mi'kmaq militia and others of the Wabanki Confederacy exacted revenge a few months later in the Siege of Pemaquid (1696).[8] As a result, Aspinquid was made a martyr and became a saint. He is buried at Mount Agamenticus in present-day Maine.[9][10]

After the death of St. Aspinquid, Father Louis-Pierre Thury officially became the missionary to the Mi'kmaq people at Shubenacadie and Chibouctou (Halifax) (1698).[11][12][13][14] Thury was the first missionary assigned to Halifax.
