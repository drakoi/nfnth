The Atakapa /əˈtækəpə, -pɑː/[1][2] (also, Atacapa), were an indigenous people of the Southeastern Woodlands, who spoke the Atakapa language and historically lived along the Gulf of Mexico. The competing Choctaw people used this term for this people, and European settlers adopted the term from them. The Atakapan people were made up of several bands. They called themselves the Ishak /iːˈʃæk/, which translates as "the people."[3] Within the Ishak there were two moieties which the Ishak identified as "The Sunrise People" and "The Sunset People".[4][5] Although the people were decimated by infectious disease after European contact and declined as a people, survivors joined other nations.
