The Atchafalaya River (/əˌtʃæf.əˈlaɪ.ə/[2] French: Atchafalaya Rivière, Spanish: Río Atchafalaya) is a 137-mile-long (220 km)[3] distributary of the Mississippi River and Red River in south central Louisiana in the United States. It flows south, just west of the Mississippi River,[4] and is the fifth largest river in North America, by discharge.[5] The name Atchafalaya comes from Choctaw for 'long river', from hachcha, 'river', and falaya, 'long'.[6]
