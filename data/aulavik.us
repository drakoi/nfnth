Aulavik National Park (/ˈaʊləvɪk/ OW-lə-vik);[2] from the Inuvialuktun for "place where people travel") is a national park located on Banks Island in the Northwest Territories of Canada.[3] It is known for its access to the Thomsen River, one of the most northerly navigable rivers in North America.[3] The park is a fly-in park, and protects approximately 12,274 square kilometres (4,739 sq mi) of Arctic Lowlands at the northern end of the island.[3][4] The most practical way to visit the park is to charter a plane,[4] and currently the park has four landing sites.[5] Aulavik is considered a polar desert and often experiences high winds. Precipitation for the park is approximately 300 mm (12 in) per year.[6] In the southern regions of the park a sparsely vegetated upland plateau reaches a height of 450 m (1,480 ft) above sea level.[7]
