Etchemin was a language of the Algonquian language family, spoken in early colonial times on the coast of Maine. The word Etchemin is thought to be either French alteration of an Algonquian word for "canoe" or a translation of "Skidijn" the native word for people in use by the inhabitants of the St. John, Passamaquoddy and St. Croix Rivers.
