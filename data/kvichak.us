The Kvichak River is a large river, about 50 miles (80 km) long, in southwestern Alaska in the United States.[3] It flows southwest from Lake Iliamna to Kvichak Bay, an arm of Bristol Bay, on the Alaska Peninsula.[4] The communities of Igiugig and Levelock lie along the Kvichak River.[4] The Kvichak is navigable along its entire length, and is used as a short cut by boats getting between Cook Inlet and Bristol Bay via the Lake Iliamna portage.
