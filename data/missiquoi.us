The Missiquoi (or the Missisquoi or the Sokoki) are a Native American tribe located in the Wabanaki region of what now is northern Vermont and southern Quebec. This Algonquian group is a sub-group of the Abenaki who lived along the eastern shore of Lake Champlain at the time of the European incursion. Their name Missiassik, which "Missisquois" is derived, means "place of flint" in the Abenaki language; or alternatively, from "Masipskoik a word that means "place where there are boulders", more specifically "boulders point."[1]
