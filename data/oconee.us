The Oconee River is a 220-mile-long (350 km)[1] river in the U.S. state of Georgia. Its origin is in Hall County and it terminates where it joins the Ocmulgee River to form the Altamaha River near Lumber City at the borders of Montgomery County, Wheeler County, and Jeff Davis County. South of Athens, two forks, known as the Middle Oconee River and North Oconee River, which flow for 55–65 miles (89–105 km) upstream respectively before converging to form the Oconee River.[2] Milledgeville, the former capital city of Georgia, lies on the Oconee River.
Harvey Averne (born 1936, Brooklyn, New York)[1] has been described as "one of several prominent Jewish Americans in New York's bustling Latin music scene."[2]
