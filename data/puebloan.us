The Ancestral Puebloans, also known as the Anasazi, were an ancient Native American culture that spanned the present-day Four Corners region of the United States, comprising southeastern Utah, northeastern Arizona, northwestern New Mexico, and southwestern Colorado.[1] The people and their archaeological culture are often referred to as "Anasazi". This, meaning "ancient enemies", was the name they were called by Navajo, who are not their descendents. Contemporary Puebloans object to the use of this term.[2][3] The Ancestral Puebloans are believed to have developed, at least in part, from the Oshara Tradition, who developed from the Picosa culture.
