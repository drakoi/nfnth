The Wəlastəkwewiyik, or Maliseet (English: /ˈmæləˌsiːt/,[1] also spelled Malecite), are an Algonquian-speaking First Nation of the Wabanaki Confederacy. They are the indigenous people of the Wəlastək River (Saint John River) valley and its tributaries. Their territory extends across the current borders of New Brunswick and Quebec in Canada, and parts of Maine in the United States.
